# Magpie — TODO / Roadmap

Status snapshot (2026-06-25): core transport works and is validated live
cross-machine (iMac ↔ MacBook over LAN/Tailscale). 86 tests green. What remains
is mode ② (real agent autonomy) + UX + hardening + reach.

## Scope decisions (2026-06-25, situation-driven)
- **THE core (S2):** two agents talk DIRECTLY, multi-turn, until **mutual
  agreement** — then report to both humans. One-shot Q&A is NOT the product
  (you wouldn't need this for that). Origin: A plans / B implements; A thinks it's
  wrong → repeated human-relayed back-and-forth until it's right → that repetition
  is the pain. Stop condition = "nothing left to resolve / agreed", with the turn
  cap only as a safety backstop. **This is the main thing still missing** (we have
  the answerer side; we lack the autonomous driver that evaluates the peer's reply
  against its own spec, pushes back, and declares agreement).
- Both sides are LIVE/present (see S3 below), so this runs over live sessions (MCP).
- **S5 (app users) is IN scope** — needs a remote HTTP MCP server (BYO-key).
- **S3 (answer-while-away from saved files): DEFERRED by decision.** Felt wrong —
  connection should require the other person to actually be working/present. So
  drop the "files-if-off" fallback for now (the live-or-files switch we built stays,
  but the file fallback is optional). Revisit later if a real need appears.
- **S6 (non-dev web watch/approve): OUT for now** — target is developers; app
  users (S5) cover participation.
- S4 (Codex/Gemini) later; S8 hard sandbox later; S9 works (harden only on public
  exposure).

## ✅ Done
- Protocol/relay/client/MCP/CLI/auto-attendant(stub)/web(stub)/conformance scaffold.
- E2E AES-GCM channel from pairing code; relay brokers ciphertext only.
- Interactive CLI send; turn-cap notifies both sides; join-race channel fix.
- Provider-ToS compliance (`docs/COMPLIANCE.md`): auth separation, mode ③ excluded.
- **Resolution + report-on-termination**: `/resolve`, CALL REPORT, persisted to
  `~/.magpie/calls/`, `history`/`report` recall. Verified live cross-machine.
- Proved a real `claude -p` agent can answer headlessly from its own files.
- **MCP in-session verified (2026-06-28)**: a real Claude Code session loaded
  `@magpie/mcp` via `--mcp-config` and patched through both directions over
  the relay — asker (`sb_join`/`sb_ask`) and answerer (`sb_listen`/read-own-repo/
  `sb_answer`), no human typing, peer text fenced. Same binary registers in
  Codex CLI / Antigravity. This is the cross-vendor substrate (slash/skill = sugar).

---

## P0 — Mode ② : real agent autonomy (the product)
- [x] **THE core: autonomous agree-loop (S2).** `AutoDriver` (drives a goal:
      ask → evaluate peer reply vs its OWN spec/files → push back → conclude) +
      `ClaudeDriver`, paired with the existing `AutoAttendant`/`ClaudeResponder`.
      Two real claude agents converse multi-turn, no human typing, and reach a
      firm AGREE conclusion (pass OR fail) with evidence, then resolve+report.
      ✅ verified live (spec 2%+max-3 vs impl → agreed "MET" with file:line evidence).
      Fixes found live: AGREE = "conclusion reached (pass/fail)" not "passed" (or it
      loops); responder must enumerate files before claiming absence (false-negative).
  - [ ] v1.1: mutual confirm (B also agrees before close) + no-progress escalate. **[PARKED]**
  - [ ] Cross-vendor live test: Claude ↔ Codex CLI over the same MCP (register
        `magpie-mcp` in `~/.codex/config.toml`; proves vendor-neutral claim). **[PARKED]**
  - [ ] `/sb` slash-command / Skill wrapper for Claude Code (thin UX over the MCP
        tools: `/sb call`, `/sb join <code>`). Optional sugar; MCP works without it. **[PARKED]**
- [x] **Real responder productized** in `@magpie/auto-attendant`:
      `ClaudeResponder` runs the official CLI with stdin closed + read-only tools
      (`--allowedTools LS Glob Grep Read "Bash(ls:*)"`), `cwd`-scoped; added a
      `magpie-attend <code>` bin. ✅ verified live: a real claude attendant
      answered an asker's project question over the relay (E2E, no refusal).
- [x] **Receiving-agent prompt tuned for TRUSTED collaborators** — "cooperative
      teammate" framing replaces the over-strict fence that made the agent refuse
      a legitimate teammate question. (Still: never executes embedded instructions,
      read-only, cwd-scoped, fail-closed CONFIDENCE.) ✅
- [x] **Out-of-scope / low-confidence no longer kills the call.** The attendant
      now DECLINES in-band ("⚠️ I can't answer that — outside my project scope; I've
      flagged it for my operator") and STAYS on the line; only the turn cap / an
      explicit hangup ends a call. ✅ verified live (in-scope → real answer;
      `~/Desktop` → polite decline, call stayed alive).
- [~] **Hybrid live-or-files responder (live-if-on, files-if-off).**
      - [x] Step 1: AutoAttendant picks `liveResponder` when `isLive()` is true,
            else the file `responder`; `goOnDuty`/`dutyPresence` give a file-mtime
            heartbeat presence with no daemon/IPC. (19 auto-attendant tests.)
      - [x] Step 2: a LIVE responder = a running Claude Code session answering
            via the Magpie MCP is verified (sb_listen → read own repo →
            sb_answer, in-session). Still optional: `magpie-attend`
            ergonomics (`--on-duty` heartbeat, handle) for the file-fallback side.
- [x] **In-session agree-loop via MCP (A).** Added a 7th tool `sb_resolve(callId,
      summary)` so a LIVE agent can conclude a call itself (sends the verdict,
      ends the call, returns the report). The driving behavior is in the MCP
      server `instructions` (loop `sb_ask` until firm conclusion → `sb_resolve`;
      responder loops `sb_listen`/`sb_answer` until closed). A peer's resolve is
      surfaced to `sb_listen` so the other side learns the conclusion. ✅ verified
      live: a real Claude Code driver session read its own SPEC.md, looped
      `sb_ask` twice (one per requirement), evaluated vs spec, and concluded with
      `sb_resolve` "MET" — no human typing. (scratchpad `mcp-loop.mjs`; 12 mcp tests.)
- [ ] **Persistent agent session** per side instead of fresh `claude -p` per turn
      (token efficiency; keeps conversation context across turns).
- [~] **Auto-resolve**: DONE for the in-session MCP path (the agent calls
      `sb_resolve` itself). Headless `AutoDriver` already auto-resolves too. The
      remaining bit is the interactive CLI still needing a human `/resolve`.
- [ ] **Terse, intent-tagged, reference-based** messages (not verbose NL);
      minimize the per-message fence overhead.

## P0 — Rust migration (efficiency / distribution) — decided 2026-06-29

**Why Rust, honestly:** the core call path is LLM-bound (~30s/turn), so Rust does
NOT speed up a conversation. The real wins are (1) **distribution** — a single
static binary relay+CLI (`brew install`, no Node runtime), serving the easy-
onboarding goal; (2) **relay at scale** — tokio, no GC tail-latency, KB/conn not
tens-of-KB; (3) smaller attack surface on the one publicly-exposed component.
The bigger *efficiency* levers are NOT the language — token efficiency
(persistent sessions) + terse/reference protocol dwarf any rewrite. So:

**NOT a big-bang rewrite. Surgical, phased, ROI-ordered.** Language boundary =
the wire protocol (ws + base64 sealed frames), so Rust and TS components
interop natively; we can swap one package at a time.

Sizes (non-test src LOC): protocol 337 · relay 673 · client 598 · mcp 964 ·
auto-attendant 948 · cli 708. Durable wire core (protocol+relay+client = ~1.6k)
is the Rust target; SDK/agent-glue (mcp+auto-attendant) stays TS for now.

**✅ ALL THREE PHASES DONE + tested (2026-06-29, via ultracode workflow — 14 agents).**
Verified independently in the main loop: Rust **59** tests, TS **109** tests
(no regression), TS-client⇄Rust-relay interop 7/7, Rust-CLI⇄TS-peer full E2E
(HKDF rendezvous + AES-256-GCM byte-identical BOTH directions, reports match).
Release binaries: CLI 1.85 MB stripped, relay 1.04 MB; cold-start **18× faster**
than Node (3.6 ms vs 66 ms). Test plan: `specs/TEST_PLAN.md`. Crypto corpus:
`specs/fixtures/crypto-vectors.json`.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Rust `relay`** (`rust/crates/magpie-relay`). Crypto-free
      drop-in; wire-identical to the TS relay (NO changes needed to pass). 13 unit
      tests + `conformance/tests/13-rust-relay-interop.test.ts` (7 scenarios via
      the real TS client against the Rust binary).
- [x] **Phase 2 — Rust `protocol`** (`magpie-protocol`). HKDF-SHA256 (empty
      salt, info `…:rendezvous:v1`/`…:channel:v1`) + AES-256-GCM (`iv‖tag‖ct`,
      detached tag, no AAD) **byte-identical to TS** — proven by cross-impl vectors
      (passed first try). 11 tests. RustCrypto (`hkdf`+`sha2`+`aes-gcm`), no regex dep.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Rust `client` + `cli`** (`magpie-client`, `magpie-cli`).
      tokio-tungstenite client (join-race fix preserved) + clap `magpie` binary
      (start/join/history/report, `/resolve` in-loop, 0600 reports). 10 + 25 tests.
- [x] **Kept TS:** MCP server + auto-attendant/driver (unchanged, all green).
- [x] **DECISION resolved:** surgical split (Rust infra + TS agent-glue). Full-Rust
      (rmcp MCP) deferred unless the split proves insufficient.

### Rust hardening follow-ups (from adversarial review — before any PUBLIC relay)
**✅ DONE 2026-07-07 (all relay-blocking items; verified by live abuse sim:
8 opens → CAPACITY, 100-frame flood → RATE_LIMITED, unknown field → BAD_FRAME):**
- [x] **HIGH** relay: pending/call caps — per-endpoint (8 pending / 32 calls) +
      global (10k each) → `CAPACITY` error (`registry.rs`).
- [x] **HIGH** relay: bounded outbound queue (256/conn, `try_send`) — a
      non-reading peer is EVICTED (writer closes the socket) instead of
      buffering unbounded.
- [x] **MED** relay+client: WS `max_message_size`/`max_frame_size` = 2 MiB
      (was tungstenite's 64 MiB default); TS relay `maxPayload` 2 MiB too
      (was ws's 100 MiB); JSON parse now happens BEFORE the global lock.
- [x] **MED** relay: poison-tolerant lock + 10 s handshake timeout + conn caps
      (4096 global / 64 per IP, reserved pre-handshake) + per-conn rate limit
      (30/s, burst 60 → `RATE_LIMITED`). Read-idle timeout deliberately NOT
      added: quiet listeners waiting for `deliver` are legitimate; caps bound
      the FD cost instead.
- [x] **MED** parity: strict unknown-field rejection on relay `ClientFrame`
      (key allowlist; serde can't deny-unknown on tagged enums) + `Message`
      `deny_unknown_fields` + `ts` ISO-8601 (Z-suffixed) validation.
- [x] **MED** protocol: `seal_with_iv` now private (ENCRYPT vector moved to an
      in-crate unit test).
- [x] **LOW** cli: `report <id>` path-traversal blocked (callId validated
      before `dir.join`).

Still open (not relay-blocking):
- [ ] **LOW** cli: SIGINT `.expect` → graceful; piped-stdin clean exit.
- [ ] **LOW** cross-impl (shared w/ TS): forgeable untrusted-content fence (use a
      per-message random nonce delimiter); pairing-code modulo bias (rejection
      sampling); UTF-16-vs-byte length caps; `maxTurns:0` clamp-vs-reject.
- [ ] TS relay: mirror pending/call caps + rate limit (dev/reference only —
      the hosted public relay is the Rust binary).

## P1 — Onboarding / OSS launch (self-host model, decided 2026-07-01)

**Model: we host NOTHING.** Open-source, users self-host the relay. No
commercialization → no hosted service/billing/token pressure. Relay is a ~1 MB
binary → trivially self-hosted (own machine + Tailscale/LAN for a trusted pair,
or a small cloud box). Onboarding = run relay → both `mcp add` at its URL → share
a pairing code.
- [x] Relay `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` (`docker build -t magpie-relay rust/
      && docker run -p 8787:8787 …`). *(Untested locally — no docker on dev box;
      relay binary itself verified via interop/E2E.)*
- [x] README self-host **Quickstart** (from-source path works today).
- [x] Repo **English-only** (de-Koreanized the two multibyte test fixtures).
- [ ] **npm publish `@magpie/{protocol,client,mcp}`** → unlocks the
      `npx -y @magpie/mcp` one-liner (the actual "dead-simple" onboarding).
      Needs: npm scope decision (is `@magpie` free?) + monorepo publish setup.
- [ ] Prebuilt relay/CLI **binaries + registry Docker image** (brew/curl install).
- [ ] **Simple website** (30-sec explainer + copy-paste per-vendor commands).
- [ ] **Flip repo public** — ONLY once the above are done (public now = pointless).
- Dropped: cloud "Deploy" button (not core); relay connect-token (only matters for
  public-internet exposure — revisit then, with the DoS caps).

## P1 — Observability / waiting UX (user-flagged)
- [x] **Basic waiting feedback** — the CLI now prints "⏳ sent — waiting for the
      other agent…" on send, so the ~30s model latency no longer looks frozen.
- [ ] **Full "peer is thinking…" signal** from the attendant side (a `system`/status
      frame the moment it starts working), richer than the local asker-side line.
- [ ] **Live transcript "watch" view** — see both sides' messages + status in real
      time (also the trust/audit surface).

## P1 — CLI / usability
- [ ] Label your **own** sent messages (`› you:`) vs inbound (`📨`) — current bare
      terminal is confusing (hit live).
- [ ] Global `magpie` command (`npm link` / install) instead of long
      `node packages/cli/dist/bin.js`.
- [ ] Pairing-code UX: 10-min TTL too short for human coordination; make TTL
      configurable + easy regenerate (hit live — codes kept expiring).
- [ ] Proper TUI (Claude-Code-like input box / panes). Wanted, lower priority.

## P1 — Routing / addressing (multi-agent: one person, many agents)
- [ ] Named-extension **directory + presence** so A can call `@b/risk` by name
      (relay registry lookup; no per-call code).
- [ ] Optional **receptionist agent** (`@b/desk`) for content-based dispatch to the
      right local agent.

## P1 — Binary trust / AV false positives (self-host distribution)
Finding (2026-07-10): on a dev Mac running Kaspersky + AhnLab ASTx, a
LOCALLY-BUILT `magpie-relay` was quarantined after being run repeatedly as a
live listening relay (behavioral proxy/backdoor heuristic — unsigned binary
that opens a port and relays). Empirically: the v0.1.0 RELEASE binaries
(magpie, magpie-mcp, magpie-relay) ALL survived on disk on the same machine,
and the CLI (outbound client) survived even when run. So:
- Hosted-relay users are UNAFFECTED — they connect to wss://…fly.dev (a remote
  service on Linux), never download/run the relay binary.
- Only self-hosters running the relay locally can hit the false positive.
- [ ] **macOS notarization + Windows Authenticode signing** of release binaries
      (Apple Developer $99/yr) — removes Gatekeeper friction AND lowers AV
      false-positive rate for self-hosters. Do before promoting self-host relay.
- [ ] Self-host docs: note the AV false-positive possibility + how to allowlist.

## P2 — Reach (cover app-only users)
- [ ] **Remote HTTP/SSE MCP server** (Claude app / ChatGPT) + **BYO-key auth**
      (never users' subscription OAuth — see COMPLIANCE.md).
- [ ] **Web client `channel.open` crypto port** — browser join/watch with real
      decryption (currently a TODO stub, no fake decrypt).

## P2 — Security / ops hardening (before any public exposure)
- [~] Relay **rate-limit + connection caps** ✅ (2026-07-07, see hardening list
      above) + access token (still open; may be unnecessary for a public relay).
- [ ] **wss/TLS** deployment (Caddy auto-TLS) guide + make it the default for
      non-local relays (hides rendezvousId; see PROTOCOL.md §6a).
- [ ] **SPAKE2 PAKE** so short codes stay MITM-safe (currently HKDF-from-code).

## P3 — Robustness / cleanup
- [ ] cross-process `magpie hangup` rejected as non-participant (minor;
      relies on SIGINT today).
- [ ] Reconnect / dropped-socket handling mid-call.
- [ ] Rename OS folder `agentmessenger` → `magpie` (cosmetic; session cwd was
      pinned, so deferred).
